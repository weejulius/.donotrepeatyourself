## Convension over configuration

* apps location: $home/apps
* repositories : $home/repositories
* the commands is ended with .sh
* all the command will be ln to $home/bin
* all the notes will be put to $home/notes by default

**$home is the current user home directory**

## Commands introduction

* syncmd will git pull and install again to synchrounize the commands
